        <ul>
          <li>By the Matthew Effect, the rich get richer and the poor stay poor</li>
          <ul>
            <li>People who start with a small advantage eventually snowballs into having a huge advantage</li>
            <li>People who are a bit behind don't get opportunities to help them catch up</li>
          </ul>
          <li>To be good at a certain thing (world professional level), you have to do it for 10 000 hours</li>
          <li><i>To become extremely proficient in a skill, you only have to be "good enough", after, it is just hard work*</i></li>
          <li>Circumstances can also lead you to success, the environment you are born in, the year/moth you were born in, family background, and culture</li>
          <li>"Knowledge of a boy's IQ is of little help if you are faced with a formful of clever boys" means specific IQ doesn't matter when they are all "smart enough"</li>
          <li>Intellect and achievement are far from perfectly correlated</li>
          <li><i>Practical intelligence</i> is knowing what to say to whom, knowing when to say it and knowing how to say it for maximum effect</li>
          <ul>
            <li>It is procedural: knowing how without knowing why and being able to explain it </li>
          </ul>
          <li>General intelligence and practical intelligence is orthogonal</li>
          <li><b>No one person makes it, mentors are important in life</b></li>
          <li>Three things make work satisfactory: autonomy, complexity, and a connection between effort and reward</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sayings from Outliers</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No food without blood and sweat</li>
          <li>Farmers are busy; farmers are busy; if farmers weren't busy, where would grain to get through the winter come from?</li>
          <li>In winter, the lazy man freezes to death</li>
          <li>Don't depend on heaven for food, but on your own two hands carrying the load</li>
          <li>Useless to ask about the crops, it all depends on hard work and fertilizer</li>
          <li>If a man works hard, the land will not be lazy</li>
          <li><i>No one who can rise before dawn 360 days a year fails to make his family rich</i></li>
          <li>It's not always the things we can't control, but the things we can</li>

        <ul>
          <li>The advice of "study hard and get good grades and you will find a high-paying job with great benefits" may have worked for people born before 1945, but it is disastrous for those of use born in a rapidly changing world</li>
          <li>Instead of telling children to play it safe, they need to be told to play it smart</li>
          <ul>
            <li>When a company announces a downsizing, families are hurt and unemployment goes up because people get laid off, but the price of the stock goes up</li>
            <li>Employees lose, but owners and investors win</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Life is the best teacher of all, life does not talk to you, it just sort of pushes you around</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If you learn life's lessons, you will do well and move on, even welcoming the pushing</li>
            <li>If not, you will continue to be pushed around, some quit while others fight</li>
          </ul>
          <li>It is easier to change yourself than everyone else</li>
          <ul><li>Most people want everyone else in the world to change, but themselves</li></ul>
          <li><i>The poor and the middle class work for money, the rich have money work for them</i></li>
          <li>The "Rat Race" is the pattern of getting up, going to work, paying bills and repeat</li>
          <ul><li>Give them more money and they just spend more</li></ul>
          <li>People are controlled by fear and greed, which is intensified by ignorance, so they react instead of think (emotion stands for energy in motion)</li>
          <ul><li>They keep working thinking money will solve their problems</li></ul>
          <li>The avoidance of money is just as psychotic as being attached to money</li>
          <li>If you want to get rich, you need to be financially literate</li>
          <ul><li>Accounting is very boring, but important for being rich in the long-term</li></ul>
          <li><i>Rule 1: know the difference between an asset and a liability</i></li>
          <ul><li>Acquire assets, not liabilities (assets put money in your pocket and liabilities take money from your pocket)</li></ul>
          <li>Money doesn't always solve the problem, it might even speed it up (intelligence solves problems)</li>
          <li>Professional success is no longer solely linked to academic success</li>
          <ul><li>People can work harder, but they don't get ahead</li></ul>
          <li>Financial aptitude is what to do with the money once you make it, how to keep people from taking it away from you, how long you keep it, and how hard that money works for you</li>
          <li>#1 expense for most people is taxes</li>
          <li>The reason public speaking are people's number one fear is the fear of standing out, criticism, ridicule, outcast, and being different </li>
          <li>The Japanese are aware of three powers: the sword, the jewel, and the mirror</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The sword symbolizes the power of weapons</li>
            <li>The jewel symbolizes the power of money</li>
            <li>The mirror symbolizes the power of self-knowledge and is the most treasured</li>
          </ul>
          <li>An intelligent person hires people smarter than they are</li>
          <li>When it comes to money, high emotions lower financial intelligence</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Mutual funds are popular because they are safe</li>
            <li>These people would not be able to capitalize on opportunities because of "risk"</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Disposable Income = Consumption + Savings</li>
            <li>The reason it is so difficult to save is because nobody wants you to</li>
            <li>Some think they need things when they really don't</li>
            <li>"Some individuals have riches just as we say have a fever when really the fever has us" - Seneca</li>
            <li>Few things in life are more valuable than our self-esteem, yet we often willingly surrender it to the opinions of others, and we spend a king's ransom trying to get it back as we buy things to try to elevate status</li>
            <li>"I can resist everything except temptation" - Oscar Wilde</li>
            <li>We aren't wired to resist temptation, but we can take away the ability to give into temptation</li>
            <li>The price we are willing to pay is based on our assessment of how much value the item will bring to our lives, but it is much more difficult to assess over a certain period of time</li>
            <li>Having friends with more money makes us want to "get on their level"</li>
            <li>"Gratitude is riches. Complaint is poverty" - Doris Day</li>
            <li>"I can't afford it" is a very powerful statement when declining invitations</li>
            <li>As we spend money on something nice, we might want other things in our life to match it, spending begets spending</li>
            <li>"Good debt" is any money borrowed to buy an appreciating asset where the cost of servicing the loan doesn't affect your ability to save to the appropriate level and where the principal will be fully repaid before your retirement</li>
            <li><b>Live in a house you can truly afford</b></li>
            <li>Pay yourself first: save first, spend the rest </li>
            <li>Keeping a detailed summary of all your expenses over a period of several months is extremely effective</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The three areas that catch most people off guard are cars, dining out, and the little things</li>
              <li>These are the areas where people spent more than they thought</li>
            </ul>
            <li>If you buy things, make sure those things are splurge-worthy</li>
            <ul><li>This makes people efficient spenders</li></ul>
            <li>By cutting back on a few little things, especially habitual purchases, people can save a large amount of money</li>
            <li>"Beware of little expenses. A small leak will sink a great ship"</li>
            <li>"I spent a lot of money on booze, birds, and fast cars. The rest I just squandered" - George Best</li>
            <li>Prioritize, think before you spend and don't wear the costume of consumer debt to pretend you're wealthier than you are</li>
            <li>Figuring out how much money needs to be set aside for retirement is difficult for many factors that involve it</li>
            <ul><li>Age of retirement, death date, tax rates during retirement years, severity of inflation, health-care costs, government plans, rate of return, etc</li></ul>
            <li>"The best time to plant an oak tree was 10 years ago. The second best time is now" - Roy Miller </li>
            <li>"Most men do not understand how great a revenue is economy" - Cicero</li>
            <li>Spend more on experiences and less on stuff</li>
            <li>"The best things in life aren't things"</li>
            <li>"Real happiness is cheap enough, yet how dearly we pay for its counterfeit" - Hosea Ballou</li>

          <p>12 Rules of Life by Jordan B. Peterson, Finished 3/30/2019</p>
          <b>Rule 1: Stand Up Straight With Your Shoulders Back</b>
          <ul>
            <li>It is a winner's take all situation in the lobster and human world, where 1% of people take 50% of the loot</li>
            <li>"To those who have everything, more will be given; from those who have nothing, everything will be taken" Matthew 25:29</li>
            <li>"It's not what we don't know that gets us in trouble. It's what we know for sure that just ain't so" - Mark Twain</li>
            <li>Like the representation of the ying and yang, chaos and order are eternally juxtaposed</li>
            <li>Change may be opportunity, instead of disaster</li>
            <li>You can delay gratification, without forgoing it forever</li>
            <li>Depression can be a positive feedback loop</li>
            <ul>
              <li>They feel useless and burdensome</li>
              <li>This makes them withdraw from contact with friends and family</li>
              <li>The withdrawl makes them feel lonesome and isolated and more likely to feel useless and burdensome</li>
              <li>They withdraw more, etc</li>
            </ul>
            <li>If you say no, early in the cycle of oppression, the scope for the oppression will remain properly bounded and limited</li>
            <li>No one likes to be pushed around, but people often put up with it for too long</li>
            <li>When people realize their own capacity for evil, their fear of themselves acting out decreases. They develop self-respect. They begin to resist oppression as they see that they have the ability to withstand as they are terrible too</li>
            <li><b>There is very little difference between the capacity for mayhem and destruction and strength of character</b></li>
            <li>If you slump, your brain assigns you a low dominance number. Your brain produces less serotonin. This will make you less happy and more likely to back down. You will get lower quality resources. You might abuse substances. It will increase your susceptibility to illness</li>
            <li><b>Those who start to have will probably get more</b></li>
            <li>If you start to straighten up, people will look at and treat you differently</li>
            <li>Standing up straight with your shoulders back is not something purely physical; it also affects your psyche</li>
            <ul>
              <li>You respond to a challenge instead of bracing for a catastrophe</li>
              <li>You see the gold the dragon hoards instead of fearing the dragon</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <b>Rule 2: Treat Yourself Like Someone You Are Responsible For Helping</b>
          <ul>
            <li>People are better at filling and properly administering perscription medications to their pets than to themselves</li>
            <li>Chaos is the domain of ignorance; it's unexplored territory</li>
            <li>Order, by contrast, is explored territory</li>
            <li><i>To straddle a fundamental duality, that we eternally inhabit order surrounded by chaos, is to be balanced: to have one foot firmly planted in order and security, and the other in chaos, possibility, growth and adventure</i></li>
            <li>The worse of all possible snakes (Garden of Eden reference) is teh eternal human proclivity for evil; it is psychological, spiritual, personal, internal; no walls, however tall, will keep that out</li>
            <li><b>It is far better to render Beings in your care competent than to protect them (parenting)</b></li>
            <li>If we wish to take care of ourselves properly, we would have to respect ourselves, but we don't, because we are fallen creatures</li>
            <li>Carl Jung's "doing unto others as you would have them do unto you" or "loving your neighbours as yourself" has nothing to do with being nice, both are equations</li>
            <li>You do not belong simply to yourself; you can't tortue or mistreat yourself because you are inevitably connected with many others</li>
            <li><b>We all deserve some respect, and we must consider what would be truly good for us</b></li>
            <li>"Happy" is not synonymous with "good"</li>
            <li>"He whose life has a why can bear almost any how" - Friedrich Nietzsche</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Rule 3: Make Friends With People Who Want The Best For You</b>
          <ul>
            <li>People choose friends who aren't good for them for a reason</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Sometimes it's because they want to rescue someone</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Not everyone at the bottom wishes to rise</li>
                <li>It is not easy to distinguish between someone truly wanting and needing help and someone who is exploiting and willing helper</li>
              </ul>
              <li>How do you know that your attempts to pull someone up won't instead bring them, or you, further down</li>
            </ul>
            <li>It's easier to put off until tomorrow what needs to be done today and drown the upcoming months and years in today's cheap pleasures</li>
            <li><b>"It is impossible to convince someone to change for the better" - Carl Rogers</b></li>
            <li>Self sacrifice might just be a person trying to look good, pretending to solve what appreas to be a difficult problem instead of actually being good and addressing something real</li>
            <li><b>It is not easy to surround yourself with good, healthy people"</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>It requires strength and daring to stand by their side</li>
              <li>It takes humility, courage, and judgment</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <b>Rule 4: Compare Yourself To Who You Were Yesterday, Not To Who Someone Else Is Today</b>
          <ul>
            <li>No matter how good you are at something, or how you rank your accomplishments, there is someone out there who makes you look incompetent</li>
            <li>The winners don't take all, but they take most</li>
            <li><b>Growing is an important form of winning</b></li>
            <li>Be cautious when comparing yourself; you have your own particular set of problems - financial, intimate, psychological, or otherwise</li>
            <li>Working towards a goal, we are always at point A, moving towards point B</li>
            <li>To focus, we must pick one thing above all else to focus on</li>
            <li>You need to know what the problems are because you can't fix something if you don't know it's broken - and you're broken</li>
            <li>The past is fixed, but the future could be better</li>
            <li><b>Happiness should be focused in the journey uphill, and not in the fleeting sense of satisfaction awaiting at the next peak</b></li>
            <li>There is an inside voice within you, once burnt and twice shy</li>
            <li><b>What you aim at determines what you see</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Perhaps what you really need is right in front of your eyes, but you cannot see it because of what you are currently aiming for</li>
              <li>You cannot aim yourself at anything if you are completely undisciplined and untutored</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Search until you find something that bothers you, that you could fix, that you would fix; that might be enough for the day</li>
            <li>Attend to the day, but aim at the highest good</li>
            <li>Realization is dawning. Instead of playing the tyrant pay attention. Tell the truth instead of manipulating the world. Instead of playing the tyrant or martyr, negotiate. You don't have to be envious because you no longer know that someone truly has it better than you. **You don't have to be frustrated if you learn to aim low and be patient** You are discovering who you are, what you want, and what you are willing to do. You are finding specific solutions to your specific problems. You are less concerned at what others do, because you yourself have plenty to do</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Rule 5 - Do Not Let Your Children Do Anything That Makes You Dislike Them</b>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Too much chaos breed too much order and vice versa</b></li>
            <li>"A man who has the indisputable favourite of his mother keeps for life the feeling of a conqueror, that confidence of success often induces real success" - Sigmund Frued</li>
            <li>It is an act of responsibility (of a parent) to discipline a child</li>
            <li>It is careful combination of mercy and long-term judgment</li>
            <li>Many adults think that any suggestion that all constraints placed on children are damaging</li>
            <ul><li>This is lazy, cruel, and inexcusable</li></ul>
            <li>It's peace that's the mystery, violence is the default</li>
            <li>Don't cast pearls before swine, don't reward your kids for misbehaving</li>
            <li>Pain is more potent than pleasure, anxiety more than hope</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Pain helps us learn</li>
              <li>We need to learn because we are stupid and easily damaged</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Children cannot be fully sheltered from fear and pain</li>
            <li>Example: child misbehaves and parents do nothing. Parents later snap at child for something completely unrelated. Child will be hurt, confused, but learn nothing</li>
            <li>Parents can discipline their kids or they give that responsibility to the harsh, uncaring, judgmental world</li>
            <li>Parents must reward those attitudes and actions that will bring their child success in the world outside the family, and use threat and punishment when necessary to eliminate behaviours that will lead to misery and failure</li>
            <li>If you're not thinking things through, then you're not acting responsibly as a parent. You're leaving the dirty work to someone else, who will be much dirtier doing it</li>
            <li><i>Four general principles of discipline</i></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Limit the rules</li>
              <li>Use the minimum necessary force</li>
              <li>Parents should come in pairs</li>
              <li>Parents should understand their own capacity to be harsh, vengeful, arrogant, resentful, angry, and deceitful</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Resentment breeds the desire for vengeance, from parent to kid</li>
            <li>Parents have a duty to act as proxies for the real world</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Rule 6 - Set Your House In Perfect Order Before You Criticize The World</b>
          <ul>
            <li>People can merge from terrible pasts to do good and not evil</li>
            <li>People who experience evil may desire to perpetuate it, to pay it forward, but it is possible to learn good by experiencing evil</li>
            <li>Start by stop doing what you know is wrong, and stop today</li>
            <li>Every person is too complex to know themselves completely and we all contain wisdom that we cannot comprehend</li>
            <li>Say only things that make you strong, do only things that you could speak of with honour</li>
            <li>The wisdom of the past was hard-earned, be sure to use it</li>
            <li><i>Don't blame capitalism, the radical left, or the iniquity of your enemies. Don't reorganize the state until you have ordered your own experience. Have some humility. If you cannot bring peace to your household, how dare you try to rule a whole city? Let your own soul guide you"</i></li>
          </ul>
          <b>Rule 7 - Pursue What Is Meaningful (Not What Is Expedient)</b>
          <ul>
            <li>life is sufferring, for dust you are and to dust you will return (Genesis)</li>
            <li>The simplest, most obvious, and most direct answer to nullify suffering? Pursue pleasure, follow your impulse, live for the moment, do what's expedient, lie, cheat, steal, deceive, manipulate, but don't get caught</li>
            <li>The fact of life's tragedy and suffering has been used to justify the pursuit of immediate selfish gratification for a very long time</li>
            <li>The pleasure of expediency may be fleeting, but it's pleasure, nonetheless, and that's something to stack up against the terrors and pain of existence</li>
            <li>Sacrifice is considering that something better might be attained in the future by giving up something of value in the present</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Your demise might be staved off through work; through the sacrifice of the now to gain benefit later</li>
              <li>There is little difference between sacrifice and work</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Asking someone for something was the most useful and immediate invitation to social interaction</li>
            <li><b>The successful among us delay gratification, the successful among us bargain with the future</b></li>
            <li>The difference between the successful and unsuccessful: the successful sacrifice</li>
            <li>When catching a monkey, have a narrow-necked jar full of treats. With a fist full of treats, the monkey cannot retract its hand. It refuses to sacrifice the part to preserve the whole</li>
            <li>Something valuable, given up, ensures future prosperity</li>
            <li><i>People have an internal spirit, voice, or daemon</i></li>
            <ul><li>Distinguishing oneself from other men, one must have a complete willingness to listen to its warnings - to stop speaking and cease acting when it objected</li></ul>
            <li>Once you become consciously aware that you, yourself, are vulnerable, you understand the nature of human vulnerability, in general</li>
            <li><b>Once you truly understood such feelings in yourself and how they're produced, you understand how to produce them in others</b></li>
            <li>Evil enters the world with self-consciousness</li>
            <li>"No tree can grow to Heaven unless its roots reach down to Hell" - Carl Gustav Jung</li>
            <li>To problems that get solved, after the solution was implemented, even the fact that such problems had ever existed disappears from view</li>
            <li><b>"We cannot invent our own values, because we cannot merely impose what we believe on our souls" - Carl Jung</b></li>
            <li>Aim up, pay attention, fix what you can fix, don't be arrogant in your knowledge, strive for humulity</li>
            <li>Become aware of your own insufficiency, consider the murderousness of your own spirit before you dare accuse others</li>
            <li>Expedience is the following of blind impulse, meaning is its mature replacement</li>
            <li>Meaning trumps expedience, meaning gratifies all impulses</li>
            <li>Expedience - that's hiding all the skeletons in the closet. That's covering all the blood you spilled on the carpet. That's avoiding responsibility. It's cowardly and shallow and wrong. It's wrong because mere expedience, multiplied by many repetitions, produces the character of a demon. It's wrong because expedience merely transfers the curve on your head to someone else, or to your future self, in a manner that will make your future, and the future generally, worse, instead of better. </li>
            <li>There is no faith and no courage and no sacrifice in doing what is expedient</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Rule 8 - Tell The Truth, Or At Least Don't Lie</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Untruth, however well-meant, can produce unintended consequences</li>
            <li>Example with Peterson and a patient. A patient earnestly tells him about his paranoia despite the lack of encouraging responses and consistent objections. He trusted Peterson because Peterson was scared, the normal reaction, no faking. There will be no understanding of the patient without that trust. </li>
            <li>A sin of commission occurs when you do something you know to be wrong. A sin of omission occurs when you let something bad happen when you could do something to stop it</li>
            <li><b>If you betray yourself, if you say untrue things, if you act out a lie, you weaken your character</b></li>
            <li><b>What saves is the willingness to learn from what you don't know</b></li>
            <li>Milton believes that subborn refusal to change in the face of error, not only meant ejection from heaven and subsequent degeneration into an ever-deepening hell, but the rejection of redemption itself</li>
            <li>You must make friends, with what you don't know, instead of what you know</li>
            <li>The attentive son can restore the vision of his father, the present can restore the past</li>
            <li>It is our responsibility to see what is before our eyes even if the horror of seeing it damages our consciousness and half-blinds us</li>
            <li>"A man's worth is determined by how much he can tolerate" - Nietzsche</li>
            <li>Set your ambitions. The better ambitions have to do with the development of character and ability, rather than status and power. Status you can lose. <b>You carry character wherever you go and it allows you to prevail against adversity</b></li>
            <ul><li>All people serve their ambition. In that matter, there are no atheists. There are only people who know and don't know what God they serve</li></ul>
            <li>Why not lie? Because things fall apart. What worked yesterday will not necessarily work today</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Rule 9 - Assume The Person You Are Listening To Might Know Something You Don't</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Psychotherapy is genuine conversation</li>
            <li>It's amazing what people will tell you if you listen</li>
            <li>The present can change what you think of or remember of the past, the future affects the present in the same way</li>
            <li>People think they think, but it's not true. It's mostly selfcriticism that passes for thinking</li>
            <li><b>Thinking is listening to yourself</b></li>
            <li>If you aren't good at thinking, you talk</li>
            <ul><li>A listening person is your collaborator and your opponent</li></ul>
            <li>You can be pretty smart to others if you can just shut up</li>
            <li><b>Listening can change people</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Some don't like to listen because they don't like change and reject it</li>
              <li>That's why listening requires courage</li>
            </ul>
            <li>You remember the past so that you are prepared for the future</li>
            <li>Talking (and thinking) is often more about forgetting than about remembering</li>
            <li><b>If you listen, without premature judgment, people will generally tell you everything they are thinking with very little deceit</b></li>
          </ul>
          <b>Rule 10 - Be Precise In Your Speech</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Don't ever underestimate the destructive power of sins of omission</li>
            <li>Thinking to not speak and 'putting up with it' doesn't solve the problem, it just starts to build up inside</li>
            <li>Everything clarified and articulated becomes visible</li>
            <li>Every single voluntarily unprocessed and uncomprehended and ignored reasons for marital failure will compound and conspire</li>
            <li>Specifying the problem would enable its solution because doing so admits it exists</li>
            <li>Everything doesn't fall apart at once; specific things fall apart; identificable beliefs failed; particular actions were false and inauthentic</li>
            <li><i>When things fall apart and chaos re-emerges, we can give structure to it, and re-establish order through our speech. If we speak carefully and precisely, we can sort things out and put them in their proper place, and set a new goal, and navigate to it if we negotiate and reach consensus. If we speak carelessly and imprecisely, things remain vague. The destinatino remains unproclaimed. The fog of uncertainty does not lift and there is no negotiating through the world.</i></li>
            <li>Damaged machinery will continue to malfunction if its problems are neither diagnosed nor fixed</li>
            <li>Precision specifies</li>
            <li>No one can have a discussion about everything, <b>talk about the small things</b></li>
            <li>You must determine where you are going in your life because you cannot get there unless you move in that direction</li>
            <li>Say what you mean so you can figure out what you mean. Act out what you say and see what happens, then pay attention. Note your errors. Articulate them. Strive to correct them. This is how you discover the meaning of your life. </li>
          </ul>
          <b>Rule 11 - Do Not Bother Children When They Are Skateboarding</b>
          <ul>

          <p>Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker, Finished 06/29/2019</p>

          <h3>By Chapter</h3>

          <h4>Part 1 - This Thing Called Sleep</h4>

          <h6>Chapter 1 - To Sleep</h6>

          <ul>
            <li><b>The shorter you sleep, the shorter your life span.</b></li>
            <li><i>"If sleep does not serve an absolutely vital function, then it is the biggest mistake the evolutionary process has ever made."</i></li>
            <li>Sleep appears to be the most foolish of biological phenomena. You can't gather food, can't socialize, can't nurture nor protect your offspring, and sleep leaves you vulnerable to predation.</li>
            <li><b>We sleep for a rich litany of functions:</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Improves our ability to learn, memorize, and make logical decisions and choices.</li>
              <li>Resets our emotional brain circuits, starting the next day fresh.</li>
              <li>Resets and reinforces our immune system, helping fight malignancy, preventing infection, and warding off all manners of sickness.</li>
              <li>Reforms the body's metabolic state by fine-tuning the balance of insulin and circulating glucose.</li>
              <li>Regulates our appetite, helping control body weight through healthy food selection rather than rash impulsivity.</li>
              <li>Maintains a flourishing microbiome within your gut.</li>
              <li>Is intimately tied to the fitness of our cardiovascular system, lowering blood pressure while keeping our hearts in fine condition.</li>
              <li>Dreaming reduces the severity of painful memories and provides a virtual reality in which the brain melds past and present knowledge, inspiring creativity.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The physical and mental impairments caused by one night of bad sleep is much more severe than those caused by an equivalent absence of food or exercise.</li>
            <li>Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day.</li>
          </ul>

          <h6>Chapter 2: Caffeine, Jet Lag, and Melatonin - Losing and Gaining Control of Your Sleep Rhythm</h6>

          <ul>
            <li>There are two main factors that determine when you want to sleep and when you want to be awake:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The first factor is a signal beamed out from your internal twenty-four-hour clock located deep within your brain.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Your twenty-four-hour clock is called your circadian rhythm.</li>
                <li>The tempo helps to determine when you want to be awake and when you want to be asleep, but it controls other rhythmic patterns too.</li>
                <li>The circadian rhythm does not come from a night and day cycle. Humans (and other plants and animals) have an internally generated circadian rhythm.</li>
                <li>Humans' cycle of wake and sleep were not precisely twenty-four hours in length.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>The light of the sun methodically resets our inaccurate internal timepiece each and every day, "winding" us back to precisely, not approximately, twenty-four hours.</li>
                  <li>The brain can also use other external cues for the purpose of biological clock resetting, as long as they are reliably repeating.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Although every human being displays an unyielding twenty-four-hour pattern, the respective peak and trough points are strikingly different from one individual to the next.</b></li>
                <ul>
                  <li>There are morning types. Makes up 40% of the populace. Wakes up at or around dawn and function optimally at this time of day.</li>
                  <li>There are evening types. Makes up 30% of the population. Prefer to go to bed late and subsequently wake up late the following morning or afternoon.</li>
                  <li>The remaining 30% lie somewhere in between morning and evening types, with a slight leaning toward eveningness.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>We live in a society that is strongly biased toward early start times that punish night owls and favor morning larks.</li>
                <li>The brain communicates its repeating signal of night and day to your brain and body using a circulating messenger called melatonin.</li>
                <li>Melatonin helps regulate the <i>timing</i> of when sleep occurs, but it has little influence on the <i>generation</i> of sleep itself.</li>
                <li>Melatonin is not a powerful sleeping aid in and of itself.</li>
                <li>For every day you are in a different time zone, your suprachiasmatic nucleus (the part of your brain that uses melatonin) can only readjust by about one hour.</li>
                <ul><li>For every hour the time zone differs by, you need an additional day to recover your natural melatonin schedule.</li></ul>
                <li>Jet lag places a torturous physiological strain on the brain, and a deep biological stress upon the cells, organs, and major systems of the body.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>The second factor is a chemical substance that builds up in your brain and creates a "sleep pressure".</li>
              <ul>
                <li>This chemical is called adenosine, which builds in your brain. The longer you are awake, the more adenosine will accumulate.</li>
                <li>You can artificially mute the sleep signal of adenosine by using a chemical that makes you feel more alert and awake: caffeine.</li>
                <li>Levels of circulating caffeine peak approximately thirty minutes after oral administration.</li>
                <li>Caffeine has an average half-life of five to seven hours (after 5 to 7 hours, 50% of the caffeine will still be circulating in your system).</li>
                <li>One cup of tea or coffee in the morning will last much of the day, and should they have a second cup, even early in the afternoon, they will find it difficult to fall asleep in the evening.</li>
                <li>The older we are, the longer it takes our brain and body to remove caffeine.</li>
                <li><b>Caffeine is the only addictive substance that we readily give to our children and teens.</b></li>
                <li>After approximately eight hours of healthy sleep in an adult, your adenosine levels are reset back to 0.</li>
                <ul><li>If you don't get enough sleep, some quantity of yesterday's adenosine remains, the sleep debt slowly building up.</li></ul>
              </ul>
              <li>The two factors, adeosine and circadian rhythm, are two distinct and separate systems that are ignorant of each other.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>

          <h6>Chapter 3: Defining and Generating Sleep - Time Dilation and What We Learned from a Baby in 1952</h6>

          <ul>
            <li>Your brain is capable of logging time with quite remarkable precision while asleep (there are times when you can naturally wake up minutes before your alarm).</li>
            <li>We sleep in 90 minute cycles, going from deep NREM sleep to REM sleep.</li>
            <ul><li><b>The vast majority of our deep NREM sleep comes from the first half of the night, while the vast majority of our REM sleep comes from the second half (most of which comes from the last sleep cycle, 6 hours to 7.5 hours).</b></li></ul>
            <li>Deep NREM sleep is weeds out and removes unnecessary neural connections. REM sleep (dreaming) strengthens those connections. </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Wake state -> reception: experiencing and constantly learning the world around you</li>
              <li>NREM sleep -> reflection: storing and strengthening those raw ingredients of new facts and skills</li>
              <li>REM sleep -> integration: interconnecting these raw ingredients with each other, with all past experiences and building an ever more accurate model of how the world works, including innovative insights and problem-solving abilities</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Key Note:</b> When losing "25%" of sleep (assuming lopping off at the end), you are losing 60 to 90 percent of your REM sleep. This also works both ways when sleeping late, resulting in a large loss of deep NREM sleep.</li>
            <li>Deep NREM sleep is also a file-transfer process.</li>
            <ul><li>Each night, memory of recent experiences will be moved from the short-term storage site to a more permanent long-term storage location (from hippocampus to neocortext). </li></ul>
          </ul>

          <h6>Chapter 4: Ape Beds, Dinosaurs, and Napping with Half a Brain - Who Sleep, How Do We Sleep, and How Much?</h6>

          <ul>
            <li>Humans (and all other species) can never "sleep back" that which have previous lost.</li>
            <li>If you bring a person into an unfamiliar sleep environment, one half of the brain sleeps a little lighter than the other (out of caution).</li>
            <li><b>There is an evolutionary imprinted lull in wakefulness a couple hours after noon that favours an afternoon nap.</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>When we are cleaved from the innate practice of biphasic sleep (sleep twice a day), our lives are shortened.</li>
              <li>The practice of natural biphasic sleep and a healthy diet appear to be the keys to a long-sustained life.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>REM sleep increases our ability to recognize and navigate socioemotional signals, increasing charisma and tact.</li>
            <li>The REM-sleep gift of facilitating accurate recognition and comprehension allows us to make more intelligent decisions and actions as a consequences.</li>
            <li>The REM-sleep dreaming state fuels creativity.</li>
          </ul>

          <h6>Chapter 5: Changes in Sleep Across the Life Span</h6>

          <ul>
            <li>Alcohol is one of the most powerful suppressors of REM sleep that we know of.</li>
            <li>REM sleep is not optional during early human life. It is obligatory.</li>
            <li>Infants and young kids display polyphasic sleep.</li>
            <li>Rationality is one of the last things to flourish in teenages, as it is the last brain territory to receive sleep's maturational treatment.</li>
            <li><b>A human's circadian rhythm changes throughout their life. A child becomes sleepy and wakes up earlier than their adult parents. Adolescent teenagers has a fast-forward rhythm, naturally sleeping and waking up later than adults.</b></li>
            <li>Neither society nor our parental attitudes are well designed to appreciate or accept that teenagers need more sleep than adults, and that they are biologically wired to obtain that sleep at a different time from their parents.</li>
            <li><b>No child needs caffeine.</b></li>
            <li>The saying that older adults simply *need* less sleep is a myth. They are simply unable to *generate* the sleep that they need.</li>
            <li>In contrast to REM sleep, which remains largely stable in midlife, the decline of deep NREM sleep is already under way by your late twenties and early thirties.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>As humans enter their 30s, there is a large reduction in deep NREM sleep. Going into mid and late forties, age will have stripped you of 60 to 70 percent of the deep sleep compared to the teen years. At 70 years old, you will have lost 80 to 90 percent of your youthful deep sleep.</li>
              <li>As humans grow elderly, many health problems arise. <b>Elderly individuals fail to connect their deterioration in health with their deterioration in sleep.</b></li>
              <li>The older we get, we also frequently wake up throughout the night, called fragmentation.</li>
              <ul><li>Due to sleep fragmentation, older individuals will suffer a reduction in sleep efficiency, defined as the percent of time you were asleep while in bed.</li></ul>
              <li>Inefficient sleep is no small thing. The lower an older individual's sleep efficiency score, the higher their mortality risk, the worse their physical health, the more likely they are to suffer from depression, the less energy they report, and the lower their cognitive function.</li>
              <li>Seniors experience a regression in sleep timing, leading to earlier and earlier bedtimes.</li>
              <li>Early-evening naps have a damaging consequence. They relieve precious sleep pressure, clearing away the sleepiness power of adenosine that had been steadily building throughout the day, making it much harder to sleep at the appropriate time during the night.</li>
              <li>Perscription melatonin has been shown to help boost the otherwise blunted circadian and associated melatonin rhythm in the elderly.</li>
              <li>The parts of our brain that ignite healthy deep sleep at night are the very same areas that degenerate earliest and most severely as we age.</li>
              <li>The stereotype of the elderly easily forgetting things is due to this severe loss in deep NREM sleep.</li>
              <li>Poor sleep is one of the most underappreciated factors contributing to cognitive and medical ill health in the elderly. </li>
              <li>Older adults suffer an unmet sleep need.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>

          <h4>Part 2 - Why Should You Sleep</h4>

          <h6>Chapter 6: Your Mother and Shakespeare Knew - The Benefits of Sleep for your Brain</h6>

          <ul>
            <li>Losing out on any one of these sleep (light NREM, deep NREM, or REM) will cause brain impairment.</li>
            <li>Sleep <i>before</i> learning refreshes our ability to initially make new memories.</li>
            <li>It is possible to 'exceed the memory limit' of our hippocampus (our short-term memory) and either not being able to add more information or overwriting one memory with another.</li>
            <li>Comparing two groups who stayed awake or took a nap in a memory cramming test, those who slept had a 20% learning advantage.</li>
            <li>Memory refreshment comes from light NREM sleep, from sleep spindles. </li>
            <ul>
              <li>The more sleep spindles an individual has at night, the greater the restoration of overnight learning ability come the next morning.</li>
              <li>The concentration of NREM-sleep spindles is especially rich in the late morning hours, between the long periods of REM sleep.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Time spent asleep helps keep newly learned informations. An equivalent time spent awake is dangerous, resulting in accelerated loss of memory.</li>
            <li>Experiments between Joh Jenkins and Karl Dallenbach shows a memory retention benefit of beetween 20 and 40% being offered by sleep, compared to the same amount of time awake.</li>
            <li>For fact-based, textbook-like memory, early night sleep, rich in deep NREM sleep, provides superior memory retention savings. </li>
            <li>Even day-time naps as short as twenty minutes helps with memory as long as they contain enough NREM sleep.</li>
            <li><b>Following a night of sleep, you regain access to memories that you could not retrieve before sleep.</b></li>
            <li>Sleep to forget (unnecessary information) deletes useless stored information and lower the brain resources required for retrieving useful memories.</li>
            <ul><li>Forgetting is the price we pay for remembering.</li></ul>
            <li>Sleep is able to help with memory improvement: one that picks which information is strengthened and which is not.</li>
            <li>Muscle memory is a misnomer. Muscle memory is actually brain memory.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Your brain continues to improve skill memories in the absence of further practice. It improves while you sleep.</li>
              <ul><li>In an experiment, people who were tested after 12 hours with sleep had a 20% increase in performance speed and 35% improvement in accuracy in a number sequence game compared to those who didn't sleep.</li></ul>
              <li><b>It is practice, followed by a night of sleep, that leads to perfection.</b></li>
              <li>Motor memories shifts over to brain circuits that operate below the level of consciousness (motor skills become unconcious) after sleep. </li>
              <li>Increases in speed and accuracy are directly related to the amount of stage 2 (light) NREM, especially in the last 2 hours of an 8-hour night of sleep, 5am to 7am, assuming a bedtime of 11pm.</li>
              <li>The last two hours of sleep that we feel is fine to cut gives us a cornucopia of benefits. <i>If you don't snooze, you lose.</i></li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Obtain less than eight hours of sleep, especially less than six, and the following happens:</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>time to physical exhaustion drops by 10 to 30%</li>
              <li>aerobic output is significantly reduced</li>
              <li>impairments are observed in limb extension force and vertical jump height</li>
              <li>decreases in peak and sustained muscle strength</li>
              <li>impairments in cardiovascular, metabolic, and respiratory capabilities</li>
              <li>faster rates of lactic acid buildup, reductions in blood oxygen saturation, increases in blood carbon dioxide, reduction in the amount of air that the lungs can expire</li>
              <li>impairment of the ability of the body to cool itself during physical excertion through sweating</li>
              <li>greater risk of injury (detrimental to school/team athletes)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>There is much that sleep can do that medicine currently cannot. </li>
            <li>A final benefit of sleep is creativity. REM sleep provides connections that your waking brain would never attempt, fusing seemingly different sets of knowledge to create a solution.</li>
          </ul>

          <h6>Chapter 7: Too Extreme for the Guinness Book of World Records - Sleep Deprivation and the Brain</h6>

          <ul>
            <li>After four hours of sleep for six nights, performance (in reaction time in this experiment) was as bad as those who had not slept for twenty-four hours straight.</li>
            <li>Day 11 of four hours of sleep, performance matched those who pulled two back-to-back all-nighters.</li>
            <li>Ten days of six hours of sleep equates to the same performance as not sleeping for 24 hours (with continued performance deterioration not leveling out)</li>
            <li><b>You do not know how sleep-deprived you are when you are sleep-deprived</b></li>
            <li>After sixteen hours of being awake, the brain begins to fail. Humans need more than seven hours of sleep each night to maintain cognitive performance.</li>
            <ul><li>Three full nights of recovery sleep are insufficient to restore performance back to normal levels after a week of short sleeping (assuming 7 hours of sleep).</li></ul>
            <li>It is lethal to drive sleepy.</li>
            <ul><li>Crashes caused by drowsy driving exceed those caused by alcohol and drugs <b>combined</b>.</li></ul>
            <li>By inserting a nap at the front end of an incoming bout of sleep deprivation, you could insert a temporary and partial buffer that would protect the brain from suffering catastrophic lapses in concentration.</li>
            <li>There exists a very rare collection of individuals who are able to survive on six hours of sleep (a fraction of 1 percent of the population).</li>
            <li>There is a 60% amplification in emotional reactivity in humans who were sleep-deprived. </li>
            <ul><li>It seems our brains revert to a primitive pattern of uncontrolled reactivity without sleep.</li></ul>
            <li>There is a 40% deficiency (grade %) in the ability of a sleep-deprived person to cram new facts into the brain relative to the group that obtains a full night of sleep.</li>
            <li>If you don't sleep the very first night after learning, you lose the chance to consolidate those memories, even if you get lots of "catch-up" sleep thereafter.</li>
            <ul><li><b>Sleep for memory consolidation is an all-or-nothing event.</b></li></ul>
            <li>Prioritizing sleep across the life span is a significant factor for lowering Alzhemer's disease risk.</li>
          </ul>
            
          <h6>Chapter 8: Cancer, Heart Attacks and A Shorter Life - Sleep Deprivation and the Body</h6>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Sleep is more than the third pillar of good health (the other two being diet and excercise). It is the foundation on which the other two health pillars sit.</b></li>
            <li>Every major system, tissue, and organ of your body suffers when sleep becomes short. No aspect of your health can retreat at the sign of sleep loss and escape unharmed. The effects of sleep deprivation can alter even your DNA.</li>
            <li>Those sleeping six hours or less were 400 to 500% more likely to suffer one or more cariac arrests than those sleeping more than six hours.</li>
            <ul><li>Primarily caused increases in blood pressure from lack of sleep.</li></ul>
            <li><i>Physical fitness (in young, fit individuals) proves no match for a short night of sleep; it offers no resistance.</i></li>
            <li>The one hour time change from daylight savings has the following results:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>When sleeping one hour less, there is a frightening spike in heart attacks the following day.</li>
              <li>When sleeping one hour more, there is a large plummet in heart attacks.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Short sleep will increase hunger and appetite, stop impulse control within the brain, increase food consumption (especially high-calorie foods), decrease feelings of food satisfaction after eating, and prevent effective weight loss when dieting.</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Inadequate sleep is the perfect recipe for obesity: greater calorie intake, lower calorie expenditure.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The less you sleep, the more you are likely to eat and your body becomes unable to manage calories effectively (leading to weight gain and increased risk of diabetes).</li>
                <li>Sleep-depriving an individual for twenty-four hours straight will only burn an extra 147 calories, relative to a twenty-four-hour period containing a full 8 hours of sleep (staying awake does not equal more calories burnt, just more calorie-intake).</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Getting enough sleep will help you control body weight, allowing you to better control cravings.</li>
              <li>Insufficient sleep will prevent the meaningful absorption of all food nutrients and cause gastrointestinal problems.</li>
              <li>When you are not getting enough sleep, the body becomes especially stingy about giving up fat. Instead, muscle mass is depleted while fat is retained. Lean and toned is unlikely to be the outcome of dieting when you are cutting sleep short.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Sleep disorders significantly lower levels of testosterone, "aging" testosterone virility by 10 to 15 years.</li>

          <h4>Part 3 - How and Why We Dream</h4>

          <h6>Chapter 9: Routinely Psychotic - REM-Sleep Dreaming</h6>

          <ul>
            <li>REM sleep can be considered as a state characterized by strong activation in isual, motor, emotional, and autobiographical memory regions of the brain, but a deactivation in regions that control rational thought.</li>
          </ul>

          <h6>Chapter 10: Dreaming as Overnight Therapy</h6>

          <ul>
            <li>There are two core benefits of REM sleep, both functional benefits require not just having REM sleep, but to dream about specific things.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The first is nursing our emotional and mental health.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>REM-sleep dreaming takes the painful sting out of difficult, even traumatic, emotional episodes you have experienced during the day, offering emotional resolution when you awake the next morning.</li>
                <ul><li>From patients, only those who were expressly dreaming about the painful experiences around the time of the events were the ones who gained clinical resolution from their despair. Those who were dreaming, but not about the painful experience, could not get past the event.</li></ul>
              <li>The second is problem solving and creativity.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>The process of REM-sleep dreaming accomplishes two critical goals:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Sleeping to <i>remember</i> the details of those valuable, salient experiences, integrating them with existing knowledge and putting them into autobiographical perspective.</li>
              <li>Sleep to <i>forget</i>, or dissolve, the visceral, painful emotinal charge that had previously been wrapped around those memories.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>You have not forgotten the memory, but you have cast off the emotional charge, or least a significant amount of it.</li>
                <li>We can therefore learn and usefully recall life events without being crippled by the emotional baggage that those painful experiences originally carried.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>To sleep is to heal.</li>
            <li>REM sleep is like a master piano tuner, one that readjusts the brain's emotional instrumentation at night to pitch-perfect precision, so that when you wake up the next morning, you can discern overt and subtly covert microexpressions with exactitude, accurately reading expressions and emotions of faces.</li>
            <ul><li>Sleep-deprived participants slipped into a default of fear bias, believing even gentle- or somewhat friendly looking faces were menacing.</li></ul>
          </ul>

          <h6>Chapter 11: Dream Creativity and Dream Control</h6>

          <ul>
            <li>The other distinct benefit of REM sleep is intelligent information processing that inspires creativity and promotes problems solving.</li>
            <li>Deep NREM sleep strengthens individual memories. REM sleep offers the masterful and complementary benefit of fusing and blending those elemtnal ingredients together, in abstract and highly novel ways.</li>
            <li>REM sleep shortcuts obvious links, favouring very distantly related concepts.</li>
            <li>Relational memory processing receives an accelerated boost from REM sleep.</li>
            <li>There is a difference between knowledge (retention of individual facts) and wisdom (knowing what they all mean when you fit them together). REM sleep allows your brain to move beyond the former and truly grasp the latter.</li>
            <li>The <i>content</i> of one's dreams, more than simply dreaming or even sleeping, also determines problem-solving success.</li>
          </ul>

          <h6>Chapter 12: Things That Go Bump in the Night - Sleep Disorders and Death Caused by No Sleep</h6>

          <ul>
            <li>Events of sleep walking arise from the deepest stage of non-dreaming (NREM) sleep.</li>
            <li>As the moment when a sleepwalking event occurs, a video recording will show a patient "awake" and behaving, but brainwave activity will display the brain is asleep.</li>
            <li>Sleep deprivation is considered as:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Having the <i>adequate ability</i> to sleep; yet</li>
              <li>Giving oneself an <i>inadequate opportunity</i> to sleep</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Insomnia is:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Suffering from an *inadequate ability* to generate sleep, despite</li>
              <li>Allowing oneself the <i>adequate opportunity</i> to get sleep</li>
            </ul>
            <li>There are many types of true insomnia with two distinctions:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Sleep <i>onset</i> insomnia - difficulty falling asleep</li>
              <li>Sleep <i>maintenance</i> insomnia - difficulty staying asleep</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Experiencing difficulty sleeping every now and then, which may last just one night or several, is normal. More than three nights a week is not.</li>
            <li>Two most common triggers of chronic insomia are psychological:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>emotional concerns, or worry</li>
              <li>emotional distress, or anxiety</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Chronic activation of the fight-or-flight nervous system causes myriad health problems, one of which is now recognized to be insomnia.</li>
            <li>A lack of sleep will kill a human being. There is a rare, genetically inherited disorder called fatal familial insomnia (FFI) which prevents sleep and kills.</li>
            <li><b>Time in bed recommendation for all adult humans is 7 to 9 hours.</b></li>
            <ul><li>The problem is that some people confuse time slept with sleep opportunity time.</li></ul>
            <li>Based on epidemiological data, any adult sleeping an average of 6.75 hours a night would be predicted to live only into their early sixties.</li>
            <li>No biological mechanisms that show sleep to be in any way harmful have been discovered (more sleep is not necessarily bad for your health).</li>
            <li>There is an adaptive balance to be struck between wakefulness and sleep. In humans, that appears to be around sixteen hours of total wakefulness, and around eight hours of total sleep, for an average adult.</li>
          </ul>

          <h6>Chapter 13: iPads, Factory Whistles, and Nightcaps - What's Stopping You from Sleeping</h6>

          <ul>
            <li>Artificial light in modern societies trick us into believing night is still day, winding our internal clock back by two to three hours on average, delaying our melatonin production.</li>
            <li>The overnight work of REM sleep, which normally assimilates complex memory knowledge, gets interfered by alcohol.</li>
            <ul><li>Nightly alcohol will disrupt your sleep and abstinence is the best.</li></ul>
            <li>Thermal environment is the most underappreciated factor determining the ease with which you will fall asleep and the quality of sleep you will obtain (low temperatures making it easier to fall asleep).</li>
            <li>Hot baths prior to bed can induce 10 to 15% more deep NREM sleep in healthy adults.</li>
            <li>Using the snooze on an alarm is repeatedly inflicting miniscule cardiovascular assault on yourself repeatedly within a short span of time.</li>
          </ul>

          <h6>Chapter 14: Hurting and Helping Your Sleep - Pill vs Therapy</h6>

          <ul>
            <li>Ambien-induced sleep (sleeping pills) causes a 50% *weakening* of the brain-cell connections originally formed during learning.</li>
            <li>Occasional users of sleeping pills (18 pills/year) are 3.6 times more likely to die than non users, with the extreme side (>132/year) being more than 5x more likely.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>One frequent cause of mortality appears to be higher-than-normal rates of infection.</li>
              <li>It is possible that medication-induced sleep does not provide the same restorative immune benefits as natural sleep.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Individuals taking sleeping pills were 30 to 40% more likely to develop cancer within the two-and-a-half year period of the study than those who were not.</li>
            <ul><li>Note: Correlation does not equal causation. Sleeping pills do not cause cancer, but the lower quality sleep may.</li></ul>
            <li>The most effective therapy for insomnia is cognitive behavioural therapy:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The obvious methods involve reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, removing screen technology from the bedroom, having a cool bedroom.</li>
              <li>Establish a regular bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends.</li>
              <li>Go to bed only when sleepy and avoid sleeping on the couch early/mid-evenings.</li>
              <li>Never lie awake in bed for a significant time period; rather, get out of bed and do something quiet and relaxing until the urge to sleep returns.</li>
              <li>Avoid daytime napping if you are having difficulty sleeping at night.</li>
              <li>Reduce anxiety-provoking thoughts and worries by learning to mentally decelerate before bed.</li>
              <li>Remove visible clockfaces from view in the bedroom, prevent clock-watching anxiety at night.</li>

            <li>Twelve Tips for Healthy Sleep</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Stick to a sleep schedule. **Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.** Set an alarm for waking up and bedtime.</li>
              <li>Exercise is great, but not too late in the day. Try to exercise at least thirty minutes on most days but not later than two to three hours before your bedtime.</li>
              <li>Avoid caffeine and nicotine. </li>
              <li>Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed, they rob you of REM sleep.</li>
              <li>Avoid large meals and beverages late at night. Might cause indigestion or bathroom visits.</li>
              <li>If possible, avoid medicines that delay or disrupt your sleep</li>
              <li><i>Don't take naps after 3pm.</i>It makes it harder to fall asleep when you're supposed to at night.</li>
              <li>Relax before bed, reading or listening to music are good options.</li>
              <li>Take a hot bed before bed.</li>
              <li>Dark bedroom, cool bedroom, gadget-free bedroom.</li>
              <li>Have the right sunlight exposure. Daylight is key to regulating daily sleep patterns.</li>
              <li>Don't lie in bed awake. If you are in bed still awake, do some relaxing activity until you feel sleepy.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Sleep may have more of an influence on exercise than exercise has on sleep. </li>
            <li>Avoid going to bed too full or too hungry, and shy away from diets that are excessively biased toward carbohydrates, especially sugar.</li>
          </ul>

          <h6>Chapter 15: Sleep and Society - What Medicine and Edicuation Are Doing Wrong; What Google and NASA Are Doing Right</h6>
          
          <ul>
            <li>The brain can never recover all the sleep it has been deprived of. "We cannot accumulate a debt without penalty, nor can we repay that sleep debt at a later time'</li>
            <li>Sleepy employees are unproductive employees. Sleep-deprived individuals also generate fewer and less accurate solutions to work-relevant problems they are challenged with.</li>
            <li>The irony that employees miss is that when you are not getting enough sleep, you work less productively and thus need to work longer to accomplish a goal. This means you often must work longer and later into the evening, arrive home later, go to bed later, and need to wake up earlier, creating a negative feedback loop. "Why try to boil a pot of water on medium heat when you could do so in half the time on high?"</li>
            <li>People do not perceive themselves as applying less effort to a work challenge, or being less effective, when they are sleep-deprived, despite both being true.</li>
            <li>In the days after a supervisor had slept poorly, the employees themselves, even if well-rested, became less engaged in their job throughout that day as a consequence.</li>
            <li><b>Those who sleep more earn more money</b> (on average).</li>
            <ul><li>An hour of extra sleep could return high wages of 4 to 5%</li></ul>
            <li>Sleep deprivation inflicts permanent physical and mental harm:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Elevates suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts.</li>
              <li>Cultivates the disabling and non-transient conditions of depression and anxiety.</li>
              <li>Increases the likelihood of a cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke), weakens the immune system, encouraging cancer and infection, and renders genitals infertile.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>REM sleep is what stands between rationality and insanity.</b></li>
            <ul><li>Subjects in an experiment were starved of REM sleep despite getting adequate amounts of deep NREM. They proceeded to express signs of psychosis, became anxious, moody, and started to hallucinate.</li></ul>
            <li><b>The lack of REM sleep that gets stripped away from children and teenages due to early school start times creates the difference between a stable and unstable mental state.</b></li>
            <li>No matter what the age, the longer a child slept, the more intellectually gifted they were.</li>
            <li>By ten years of age, the twin with the longer sleep pattern was superior in their intellectual and educational abilities, with higher scores on standardized tests of reading and comprehension, and a more expansive vocabulary than the twin who was obtaining less sleep.</li>
            <li><b>A tired, under-slept brain is little more than a leaky memory sieve, in no state to receive, absorb, or efficiently retain an education.</b></li>
            <li>If you are about to receive medical treatment at a hospital, you'd be well advised to ask the doctor: "How much sleep have you had in the past twenty-four hours?" No amount of years on the job helps a doctor "learn" how to overcome a lack of sleep and develop resilience.</li>

          <h3>By Section</h3>

          <h5>Sleeping</h5>

          <ul>
            <li><b>We sleep for a rich litany of functions:</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Improves our ability to learn, memorize, and make logical decisions and choices</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Sleep <i>before</i> learning refreshes our ability to initially make new memories.</li>
                <li>It is possible to 'exceed the memory limit' of our hippocampus (our short-term memory) and either not being able to add more information or overwriting one memory with another.</li>
                <li>Comparing two groups who stayed awake or took a nap in a memory cramming test, those who slept had a 20% learning advantage.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Resets our emotional brain circuits, starting the next day fresh</li>
              <li>Resets and reinforces our immune system, helping fight malignancy, preventing infection, and warding off all manners of sickness.</li>
              <li>Reforms the body's metabolic state by fine-tuning the balance of insulin and circulating glucose.</li>
              <li>Regulates our appetite, helping control body weight through healthy food selection rather than rash impulsivity.</li>
              <li>Maintains a flourishing microbiome within your gut.</li>
              <li>Is intimately tied to the fitness of our cardiovascular system, lowering blood pressure while keeping our hearts in fine condition.</li>
              <li>Dreaming reduces the severity of painful memories and provides a virtual reality in which the brain melds past and present knowledge, inspiring creativity.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>After approximately eight hours of healthy sleep in an adult, your adenosine levels, the sleep pressure that builds the longer you are awake, are reset back to 0.</li>
            <li>Afternoon naps (Biphasic sleep) are part of our biology and leads to a longer life.</li>
            <li><b>Following a night of sleep, you regain access to memories that you could not retrieve before sleep.</b></li>
            <li>Sleep to forget (unnecessary information) deletes useless stored information and lower the brain resources required for retrieving useful memories.</li>
            <li><b>Those who sleep more earn more money</b> (on average)</li>
            <ul><li>An hour of extra sleep could return high wages of 4 to 5%</li></ul>
            <li>No matter what the age, the longer a child slept, the more intellectually gifted they were.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Not Sleeping</h5>

          <ul>
            <li>The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life span.</li>
            <li>If you don't get enough sleep, some quantity of yesterday's adenosine remains, the sleep debt slowly building up.</li>
            <li>Poor sleep is one of the most underappreciated factors contributing to cognitive and medical ill health in the elderly.</li>
            <li>Losing out on any one of these sleep (light NREM, deep NREM, or REM) will cause brain impairment.</li>
            <li>The last two hours of sleep that we feel is fine to cut gives us a cornucopia of benefits. <i>If you don't snooze, you lose.</i></li>
            <li><b>Obtain less than eight hours of sleep, especially less than six, and the following happens:</b></li>

              <li>aerobic output is significantly reduced</li>
              <li>impairments are observed in limb extension force and vertical jump height</li>
              <li>decreases in peak and sustained muscle strength</li>
              <li>impairments in cardiovascular, metabolic, and respiratory capabilities</li>
              <li>faster rates of lactic acid buildup, reductions in blood oxygen saturation, increases in blood carbon dioxide, reduction in the amount of air that the lungs can expire</li>
              <li>impairment of the ability of the body to cool itself during physical excertion through sweating</li>
              <li>greater risk of injury (detrimental to school/team athletes)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Constantly sleeping less is as bad as not sleeping at all</li>
            <ul>
              <li>After four hours of sleep for six nights, performance (in reaction time in this experiment) was as bad as those who had not slept for twenty-four hours straight.</li>
              <li>Day 11 of four hours of sleep, performance matched those who pulled two back-to-back all-nighters.</li>
              <li>Ten days of six hours of sleep equates to the same performance as not sleeping for 24 hours (with continued performance deterioration not leveling out).</li>
            </ul>
            <li>After sixteen hours of being awake, the brain begins to fail. Humans need more than seven hours of sleep each night to maintain cognitive performance.</li>
            <ul><li>Three full nights of recovery sleep are insufficient to restore performance back to normal levels after a week of short sleeping (assuming 7 hours of sleep).</li></ul>
            <li>There is a 60% amplification in emotional reactivity in humans who were sleep-deprived. </li>
            <li>There is a 40% deficiency (grade %) in the ability of a sleep-deprived person to cram new facts into the brain relative to the group that obtains a full night of sleep.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>If you don't sleep the very first night after learning, you lose the chance to consolidate those memories, even if you get lots of "catch-up" sleep thereafter.</li>
              <li><b>Sleep for memory consolidation is an all-or-nothing event.</b></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Those sleeping six hours or less were 400 to 500% more likely to suffer one or more cariac arrests than those sleeping more than six hours.</li>
            <li><b>Short sleep will increase hunger and appetite, stop impulse control within the brain, increase food consumption (especially high-calorie foods), decrease feelings of food satisfaction after eating, and prevent effective weight loss when dieting.</b></li>
            <li>Sleep disorders significantly lower levels of testosterone, "aging" testosterone virility by 10 to 15 years.</li>
            <li>Faces pictured after one night of short sleep were rated as significantly less attractive than the same individual after eight hours (beauty sleep is real!).</li>
            <li>The less sleep an individual were getting in the week before facing the active common cold virus, the more likely it was that they would be infected and catch a cold.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>In those sleeping five hours on average, infection rate was almost 50%.</li>
              <li>In those sleeping seven hours of more, infection reate was 18%.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once you miss out on the benefit of sleep the night after an immunity shot for the flu, you cannot regain the benefit simply by trying to catch up on lost sleep. The damage is don and some of that harm can still be measured a year later.</li>
            <li>Examining healthy, young men, a single night of four hours of sleep sweeps away 70% of the natural killer cells (identifies and eliminates dangerous foreign elements in your body) circulating in the immune system, relative to a full eight-hour night of sleep.</li>
            <li>Sleeping less than six hours is associated with a 40% increased risk of developing cancer, relative to those sleeping seven hours or more.</li>
            <ul><li>Poor sleep quality increases the risk of cancer development and, if cancer is established, provides a rich environment for its rapid and more rampant growth.</li></ul>
            <li>Chronic sleep loss will erode your genetic code and the structure that encapsulates it.</li>
            <ul><li>The less sleep an individual obtains, or the worse the quality of sleep, the more damaged the capstone telomeres of that individual's chromosomes.</li></ul>
            <li>Sleepy employees are unproductive employees. Sleep-deprived individuals also generate fewer and less accurate solutions to work-relevant problems they are challenged with.</li>
            <li>In the days after a supervisor had slept poorly, the employees themselves, even if well-rested, became less engaged in their job throughout that day as a consequence.</li>
            <li>Sleep deprivation inflicts permanent physical and mental harm:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Elevates suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts.</li>
              <li>Cultivates the disabling and non-transient conditions of depression and anxiety.</li>
              <li>Increases the likelihood of a cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke), weakens the immune system, encouraging cancer and infection, and renders genitals infertile.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>The lack of REM sleep that gets stripped away from children and teenages due to early school start times creates the difference between a stable and unstable mental state.</b></li>
            <li><b>A tired, under-slept brain is little more than a leaky memory sieve, in no state to receive, absorb, or efficiently retain an education.</b></li>
          </ul>

          <h5>About REM and deep NREM sleep</h5>

          <ul>
            <li>We sleep in 90 minute cycles, going from deep NREM sleep to REM sleep.</li>
            <ul><li><b>The vast majority of our deep NREM sleep comes from the first half of the night, while the vast majority of our REM sleep comes from the second half (most of which comes from the last sleep cycle, 6 hours to 7.5 hours).</b></li></ul>
            <li>Deep NREM sleep is weeds out and removes unnecessary neural connections. REM sleep (dreaming) strengthens those connections. </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Wake state -> reception: experiencing and constantly learning the world around you</li>
              <li>NREM sleep -> reflection: storing and strengthening those raw ingredients of new facts and skills</li>
              <li>REM sleep -> integration: interconnecting these raw ingredients with each other, with all past experiences and building an ever more accurate model of how the world works, including innovative insights and problem-solving abilities</li>
            </ul>
            <li>In contrast to REM sleep, which remains largely stable in midlife, the decline of deep NREM sleep is already under way by your late twenties and early thirties.</li>
            <li>More about deep NREM:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Deep NREM sleep is also a file-transfer process. </li>
              <ul><li>Each night, memory of recent experiences will be moved from the short-term storage site to a more permanent long-term storage location (from hippocampus to neocortext).</li></ul>
              <li>Memory refreshment comes from light NREM sleep, from sleep spindles. </li>
              <ul><li>The more sleep spindles an individual has at night, the greater the restoration of overnight learning ability come the next morning.</li></ul>
              <li>For fact-based, textbook-like memory, early night sleep, rich in deep NREM sleep, provides superior memory retention savings. </li>
              <ul><li>Even day-time naps as short as twenty minutes helps with memory as long as they contain enough NREM sleep.</li></ul>
            </ul>
            <li>More about REM sleep:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>REM sleep increases our ability to recognize and navigate socioemotional signals, increasing charisma and tact.</li>
              <li>The REM-sleep gift of facilitating accurate recognition and comprehension allows us to make more intelligent decisions and actions as a consequences.</li>
              <li>The REM-sleep dreaming state fuels creativity.</li>
              <li>REM sleep is not optional during early human life. It is obligatory.</li>
              <li>REM sleep provides connections that your waking brain would never attempt, fusing seemingly different sets of knowledge to create a solution.</li>
              <li>The two core benefits of REM sleep: Nursing our emotional and mental health and problem solving and creativity.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>REM-sleep dreaming takes the painful sting out of difficult, even traumatic, emotional episodes you have experienced during the day, offering emotional resolution when you awake the next morning.</li>
                <li>REM sleep shortcuts obvious links, favouring very distantly related concepts.</li>
                <li>Relational memory processing receives an accelerated boost from REM sleep.</li>
              </ul>
              <li><b>REM sleep is what stands between rationality and insanity.</b></li>
            </ul>
          </ul>

          <h5>Sleep Preventors</h5>

          <ul>
            <li>One cup of tea or coffee in the morning will last much of the day, and should they have a second cup, even early in the afternoon, they will find it difficult to fall asleep in the evening.</li>
            <ul><li>The older we are, the longer it takes our brain and body to remove caffeine.</li></ul>
            <li>Alcohol is one of the most powerful suppressors of REM sleep that we know of.</li>
            <li>Early-evening naps have a damaging consequence. They relieve precious sleep pressure, clearing away the sleepiness power of adenosine that had been steadily building throughout the day, making it much harder to sleep at the appropriate time during the night.</li>
            <li>Artificial light in modern societies trick us into believing night is still day, winding our internal clock back by two to three hours on average, delaying our melatonin production.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Good Sleep Practices</h5>

          <ul>
            <li>Thermal environment is the most underappreciated factor determining the ease with which you will fall asleep and the quality of sleep you will obtain (low temperatures making it easier to fall asleep).</li>
            <li>Hot baths prior to bed can induce 10 to 15% more deep NREM sleep in healthy adults.</li>
            <li><b>Establish a regular bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends.</b></li>
            <li>Go to bed only when sleepy and avoid sleeping on the couch early/mid-evenings.</li>
            <li>Never lie awake in bed for a significant time period; rather, get out of bed and do something quiet and relaxing until the urge to sleep returns.</li>
            <li>Avoid daytime napping if you are having difficulty sleeping at night.</li>
            <li>Reduce anxiety-provoking thoughts and worries by learning to mentally decelerate before bed.</li>
            <li>Remove visible clockfaces from view in the bedroom, prevent clock-watching anxiety at night.</li>
            <li>Exercise is great, but not too late in the day. Try to exercise at least thirty minutes on most days but not later than two to three hours before your bedtime.</li>
            <li>Avoid large meals and beverages late at night. Might cause indigestion or bathroom visits.</li>
            <li>If possible, avoid medicines that delay or disrupt your sleep.</li>
            <li>Dark bedroom, cool bedroom, gadget-free bedroom.</li>
            <li>Have the right sunlight exposure. Daylight is key to regulating daily sleep patterns.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Other</h5>

          <ul>
            <li>Different circadian rhythms exist in human beings. 40% of people are morning larks, 30% are night owls, and the last 30% are somewhere in between, leaning slightly more to the evening.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Society is currently strongly biased in favour of morning larks and punishes the night owls.</li>
              <li><b>A human's circadian rhythm changes throughout their life. A child becomes sleepy and wakes up earlier than their adult parents. Adolescent teenagers has a fast-forward rhythm, naturally sleeping and waking up later than adults.</b></li>
            </ul>
            <li>The two factors of sleeping and waking, adeosine and circadian rhythm, are two distinct and separate systems that are ignorant of each other.</li>
            <li>You can never make up a lack of sleep (a debt of sleep can never be repaid at a later date).</li>
            <li>Poor sleep is one of the most underappreciated factors contributing to cognitive and medical ill health in the elderly. </li>
            <li>There exists a very rare collection of individuals who are able to survive on six hours of sleep (a fraction of 1 percent of the population).</li>
            <li><i>Physical fitness (in young, fit individuals) proves no match for a short night of sleep; it offers no resistance.</i></li>

    <br><br>
    <h5>Basic Information</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Docker is a process, to be used in Shell, that lets us run multiple containers from different available images. </li>
      <li>What is an image? It is the source code, binaries, and libraries of an application.</li>
      <li>What is container? It is an instance of the image as a process.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Docker Container Commands</h4>
    <div>
      <b><i>Side Note: To get a list of commands and/or modifications to commands, enter <code>(command) --help</code></i></b>
      <br>
      Example: <code>docker container --help</code>, <code>docker container start --help</code>, <code>docker image --help</code>, etc
    </div>
    <div>
      <b><code>Docker Container Run</code></b>
      <div>
        This is the most basic and important Docker Container commands. It can be executed in many ways depending on what is added to the command. 
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>docker container run (name of image)</code> : runs a container based on the image.
            <ul><li>Side Note: <code>docker container run</code> must be at the beginning of the command. The image specification must be at the end of the command. Any additional modifications are added in the middle of the command </li></ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <b>Modifications</b>
        <div><i>REMINDER</i>: Modifications must be added between 'docker container run' and the name of the image</div>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li><code>-it</code>: starts a container interactively</li>
        <li><code>-d</code>: runs a container in the background (d stands for daemon)</li>
        <li><code>--name</code>: names the created container</li>
        <li><code>-p HOST POST:CONTAINER PORT</code>: publishes the container where the CONTAINER PORT is the port at which the container listens and the HOST PORT is the port where a user can access the container</li>
        <li><code>-e</code>: sets environment variables </li>
        <li><code>-v</code>: bind mounts a volume</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Other Docker Container Commands</h4>
      <div><i>Side Note: Some commands have additional modifications. To get an extensive list, you can always add --help to the end of any command</i></div>   
      <ul>
        <li><code>docker container start (id of container)</code>: starts a stopped container</li>
        <ul><li>Side Note: You do not need to put in the full id of the container. You only need to put in the first 3 characters or more, simply making sure the ID is unique</li></ul>
        <li><code>docker container stop (id of container)</code>: stops the container from running</li>
        <li><code>docker container rm (list of container id's)</code>: removes all stopped containers within the list of container id's, running containers will not be removed and you will be informed that they could not be removed</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Side Note: adding '-f', force, after rm, will remove stopped and running containers, removing all the containers within the list </li>
          <li>Side Note: <code>docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)</code> removes all stopped containers </li>
          <li>Side Note: Similarly, <code>docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)</code> removes all containers </li>
        </ul>
        <li><code>docker container ls</code>: lists all running/active containers </li>
        <ul><li>Side Note: <code>docker ps</code> also achieves the same result</li></ul>
