        <p>Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell, Finished 6/10/2018</p>
        <ul>
          <li>By the Matthew Effect, the rich get richer and the poor stay poor</li>
          <ul>
            <li>People who start with a small advantage eventually snowballs into having a huge advantage</li>
            <li>People who are a bit behind don't get opportunities to help them catch up</li>
          </ul>
          <li>To be good at a certain thing (world professional level), you have to do it for 10 000 hours</li>
          <li><i>To become extremely proficient in a skill, you only have to be "good enough", after, it is just hard work*</i></li>
          <li>Circumstances can also lead you to success, the environment you are born in, the year/moth you were born in, family background, and culture</li>
          <li>"Knowledge of a boy's IQ is of little help if you are faced with a formful of clever boys" means specific IQ doesn't matter when they are all "smart enough"</li>
          <li>Intellect and achievement are far from perfectly correlated</li>
          <li><i>Practical intelligence</i> is knowing what to say to whom, knowing when to say it and knowing how to say it for maximum effect</li>
          <ul>
            <li>It is procedural: knowing how without knowing why and being able to explain it </li>
          </ul>
          <li>General intelligence and practical intelligence is orthogonal</li>
          <li><b>No one person makes it, mentors are important in life</b></li>
          <li>Three things make work satisfactory: autonomy, complexity, and a connection between effort and reward</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sayings from Outliers</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No food without blood and sweat</li>
          <li>Farmers are busy; farmers are busy; if farmers weren't busy, where would grain to get through the winter come from?</li>
          <li>In winter, the lazy man freezes to death</li>
          <li>Don't depend on heaven for food, but on your own two hands carrying the load</li>
          <li>Useless to ask about the crops, it all depends on hard work and fertilizer</li>
          <li>If a man works hard, the land will not be lazy</li>
          <li><i>No one who can rise before dawn 360 days a year fails to make his family rich</i></li>
          <li>It's not always the things we can't control, but the things we can</li>

        <ul>
          <li>The advice of "study hard and get good grades and you will find a high-paying job with great benefits" may have worked for people born before 1945, but it is disastrous for those of use born in a rapidly changing world</li>
          <li>Instead of telling children to play it safe, they need to be told to play it smart</li>
          <ul>
            <li>When a company announces a downsizing, families are hurt and unemployment goes up because people get laid off, but the price of the stock goes up</li>
            <li>Employees lose, but owners and investors win</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Life is the best teacher of all, life does not talk to you, it just sort of pushes you around</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If you learn life's lessons, you will do well and move on, even welcoming the pushing</li>
            <li>If not, you will continue to be pushed around, some quit while others fight</li>
          </ul>
          <li>It is easier to change yourself than everyone else</li>
          <ul><li>Most people want everyone else in the world to change, but themselves</li></ul>
          <li><i>The poor and the middle class work for money, the rich have money work for them</i></li>
          <li>The "Rat Race" is the pattern of getting up, going to work, paying bills and repeat</li>
          <ul><li>Give them more money and they just spend more</li></ul>
          <li>People are controlled by fear and greed, which is intensified by ignorance, so they react instead of think (emotion stands for energy in motion)</li>
          <ul><li>They keep working thinking money will solve their problems</li></ul>
          <li>The avoidance of money is just as psychotic as being attached to money</li>
          <li>If you want to get rich, you need to be financially literate</li>
          <ul><li>Accounting is very boring, but important for being rich in the long-term</li></ul>
          <li><i>Rule 1: know the difference between an asset and a liability</i></li>
          <ul><li>Acquire assets, not liabilities (assets put money in your pocket and liabilities take money from your pocket)</li></ul>
          <li>Money doesn't always solve the problem, it might even speed it up (intelligence solves problems)</li>
          <li>Professional success is no longer solely linked to academic success</li>
          <ul><li>People can work harder, but they don't get ahead</li></ul>
          <li>Financial aptitude is what to do with the money once you make it, how to keep people from taking it away from you, how long you keep it, and how hard that money works for you</li>
          <li>#1 expense for most people is taxes</li>
          <li>The reason public speaking are people's number one fear is the fear of standing out, criticism, ridicule, outcast, and being different </li>
          <li>The Japanese are aware of three powers: the sword, the jewel, and the mirror</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The sword symbolizes the power of weapons</li>
            <li>The jewel symbolizes the power of money</li>
            <li>The mirror symbolizes the power of self-knowledge and is the most treasured</li>
          </ul>
          <li>An intelligent person hires people smarter than they are</li>
          <li>When it comes to money, high emotions lower financial intelligence</li>
          <li>The middle class love to play it safe</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Mutual funds are popular because they are safe</li>
            <li>These people would not be able to capitalize on opportunities because of "risk"</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Wealth is a person's ability to survive so many number of days forward: "If I stopped working today, how long could I survive</b></li>
          <li><b>Mind your own business</b></li>
          <ul><li>It is important to keep track of your asset column or whatever makes you money</li></ul>
          <li>Keep you expenses low, reduce liabilities, and build a base of solid assets</li>
          <li>Assets fall under into the following:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Businesses that don't require your presence</li>
            <li>Stocks</li>

            <li>Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts, patents</li>
          </ul>
          <li>When investing, once a dollar goes in, don't let it come out, think of it as an employee that works 24/7</li>
          <li>The reward at the end of the road for diligently taking the time to mind your own business are the luxuries</li>
          <li><b>Financial IQ is made up of knowledge from four broad areas of expertise</b></li>
          <ul>

            <li>Understanding Markets - science of supply and demand</li>
            <li>Law - tax advantage and protection from lawsuits from being aware of accounting, corporate, state, and national rules and regulations</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Skills are needed to be an investor who creates investments:</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>How to find an opportunity that everyone has missed</li>
            <li>How to raise money (without a bank)</li>
            <li>How to organize smart people</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>There is always risk, so learn to manage risk instead of avoiding it</b></li>
          <li>Talented people are always one skill away from great wealth</li>
          <ul><li>When it comes to money, the only skill most people know is to work hard</li></ul>
          <li><b>You want to learn a little about a lot (20 hours rule)</b></li>
          <li>The hardest part of running a company is managing people</li>
          <ul><li>If you are not a good leader, you'll get shot in the back</li></ul>
          <li>It is best to go broke before 30</li>
          <li>A job is just an acronym for 'Just Over Broke'</li>
          <li>If baby boomers discover they don't have enough money to live on when they're older, they can blow their brains out with the silver bullet</li>
          <li>"I'm not interested in going to the gym, but I go because I want to feel better and live longer"</li>

          </ul>
          <li>The better you are at communicating, negotiating, and handling your fear of rejection, the easier life is</li>
          <li>The more you give, the more you receive (even if you don't have 'extra' money)</li>
          <li>5 reasons why people don't develop proper assets columns</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Fear - fear of losing money, think Texan: go big or go home, winning usually follows losing, everyone wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die, REMEMBER THE ALAMO!!!</li>
            <li>Cynicism - ignore the Chicken Little, the extra "noise", cynics criticise, winners analyze, criticism blinds while analysis opens eyes</li>
            <li>Laziness - there is laziness in staying busy, fix laziness with greed, ask "how can I afford it?"</li>
            <li>Bad Habits - our lives are a reflection of our habits</li>
            <li>Arrogance - arrogance is just ego + ignorance</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Texans don't bury their failures</li>
          <ul>
            <li>They turn them into rallying cries</li>
            <li>Failure inspires winners and defeats losers</li>
          </ul>
          <li>To make progress, you must go unbalanced, that's how walking works</li>
          <li>You must focus to be rich, put a lot of eggs in a few baskets</li>
          <li>When exiting the rat race, you must ask yourself "How can I afford to never work again?", "What's in it for me if I'm healthy, sexy, good-looking?", "What would my life be like if I never had to work again?", "What would I do if I had all the money I needed"</li>
          <li><b>Ten steps/helpful tips</b></li>
          <ul>
